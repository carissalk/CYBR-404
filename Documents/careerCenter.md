The career center presentation included a lot of information that I knew already, but also some new components to add to my professional interactions. One things I absolutely cannot stand is networking and it is always a challenge for me to push myself into that environment. It helps me to consider the conversations as explorative, so I enjoyed the specific advice we got to ask questions that will inspire a story in return. I will definitely incorporate that into my interactions going forward. The other takeaway I got from this presentation is the positive impact of a handshake. I would not have guessed it would carry as much weight as she was suggesting.
